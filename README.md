# Searching for a connection between maximum entropy and the arrow of time: Python code
### *Author: Aiden Lewis*

This project simulates a 1-dimensional Ising model of a lattice of spins and bonds using the probabilistic Metropolis and deterministic Creutz algorithms. Its purpose was to investigate the relationship between reversible microscopic and irreversible macroscopic physics based on analysing the system's entropy.

### To run the code
Simply enter `python main.py` into a command line terminal (with an activated conda environment) within this directory. The required packages are:
- `numpy`
- `sys`
- `os`
- `matplotlib`
- `random`
- `pickle`

All user-specified parameters can be found at the beginning of the `run` method in `main.py`.
