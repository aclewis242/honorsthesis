First third of simulation: bonds do change. Freeze for second third, restore for last third
Plot ln(KE)-ln(KE0) against time

We want the Metropolis and Creutz algorithms to give the same energy distribution (Boltzmann, *not* Maxwell-Boltzmann)

Exponential (aligned) until you stop changing bonds. They deviate a lot, but then begin to come back together at long times. This is good

Bond changing and spin-flips are on a different timescale. This is where the arrow comes from

The 1D model gives a clear way of getting a clean break between regions; hard to do in 2D
