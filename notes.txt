First third of simulation: bonds do change. Freeze for second third, restore for last third
Plot ln(KE)-ln(KE0) against time

We want the Metropolis and Creutz algorithms to give the same energy distribution (Boltzmann, *not* Maxwell-Boltzmann)

Exponential (aligned) until you stop changing bonds. They deviate a lot, but then begin to come back together at long times. This is good

Bond changing and spin-flips are on a different timescale. This is where the arrow comes from

The 1D model gives a clear way of getting a clean break between regions; hard to do in 2D

Questions for Chamberlin:
- How do I demonstrate that the distribution given by the model is in fact the Boltzmann distribution?
	- Make histograms for different blocks of time (say, 3 per third). Take the natural log of each energy's value, take the differences in those values between the various energies. Plot those differences over time;
	  it should be the case that they stay aligned for the first third, deviate for the second, and then come back at the third. Should be symmetrical, hopefully
	- The Boltzmann distribution says that the probability is proportional to e^(-E/kT). It can be shown mathematically that the ln values as above should be the same -- this is the 'aligned' state of affairs
- Generally speaking, what should the distribution for the Metropolis algorithm look like? (It gives me something that looks radically different from the Creutz algorithm, which feels not very good)
	- This is just something that's already known (it follows Boltzmann)
- Is the Creutz model supposed to be irreversible under the whole bond-third-thing I've implemented? It doesn't seem to be, and as far as I know that's kind of the point
	- We don't actually have enough to prove the result we wanted to, but we have shown that thermal equilibrium gets yeeted in this model, which suggests that we're on the right track. But further research is required
	  to prove that we are
	- It is worth saying (hopefully with a figure or two from Chamberlin) that the thermal equilibrium thing is helped by the pseudo-thermal-bath of choosing random demon sites to nab energy from. But this is secondary
	  to explaining my own results...
	- ...namely, that the thermal equilibrium relies on both the bond making and the spin flipping happening on the same timescale. It breaks when they don't (as in the bond-third-thing)
- How do we justify that the bond-third-thing I've done is realistic?
	- It's a sort of thought experiment; physical justification comes from the timescale aspect (this is just one way of implementing the timescale difference) (he has found similar results with 10% as fast and such)
	  (this is known empirically) (cite that paper he sent)
- How does entropy fit into all of this?
	- Related to the thermal equilibrium thing. When the demons don't obey the Boltzmann distribution, they're not in thermal equilibrium, and thus not at maximum entropy
- What even is the energy distribution of the Metropolis model meant to be drawn from? Is what I have accurate, or should it be done differently?

- All in all, would the ideal path of logic for me to follow be something like:
	- 1: We already know empirically that the Metropolis model describes reality accurately, and its energies obey the Boltzmann distribution
	- 2: The deterministic Creutz model is reversible in its "default" state, but when we implement bond breaking as above, it becomes irreversible
	- 3: In its irreversible state, the energies of the Creutz model also obey the Boltzmann distribution (like the Metropolis model)
	- 4: Therefore, since it gives results that are statistically the same as those of the Metropolis model, we know that the Creutz model is also an accurate picture of reality from a statistical perspective
	- 5: This is important because it demonstrates that both the arrow of time and the aforementioned statistical results can be produced in a deterministic and realistic context, thereby bridging the gap between "normal"
		 physics and thermodynamics

- More generally, I'm not quite sure what the final product is supposed to *be*, exactly. Would I be correct in believing that, structurally speaking, it's akin to the reports we write for lab classes (just more extensive/
detailed)?
- What do I expect out of the defense? I don't really have a point of reference for that, either

- Avg the blue lines and compare with temp. measured according to the KE expression he mentioned but couldn't remember
